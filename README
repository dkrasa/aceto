            Accelerated Charge and Energy Transfer Objects (ACETO) library
 
Contains Fortran (2003) routines for some common tasks in quantum theory of molecular charge
and energy transfer theory. 

Preferred pronounciation of the library's abbreviation is the Italian one. ACETO means vinegar
in Italian. The library is designed to add some extra flavour to another project, the Python
open quantum system theory package Quantarhei (see http://github.com/tmancal74/quantarhei).
